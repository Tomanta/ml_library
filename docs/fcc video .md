    4. Schedule project
2. Data Prep
    1. Get data
    2. Clean data
    3. Explore data
    4. Refine data
        - choosing variables
        - choosing cases to include/exclude
        - data transformations
3. Modeling
    1. Create statistical model
        - regression analysis
        - neural network
        - etc
    2. Validate model
    3. Evaluate model
    4. Refine model
        - remove / add new variables
        - transform data
4. Follow Up
    1. Present model
    2. Deploy model
    3. Revisit model
    4. Archive assets

## Methods Overview

1. Sourcing
    - Getting the raw materials
        - Existing data
            - In house
            - Open data
            - Third party data
        - APIs
        - web scraping
        - creating data
            - Interviews
            - Surveys
            - Experiments
    - Pay attention to metrics & methods
        - Business metrics
        - KPI's
        - SMART goals (smart / actional / timely )
        - Classification accuracy
2. Coding
    - Any technology that lets you manipulate the data
    - Specialized apps for working with data
        - Spreadsheets
        - Visualization tools (Tableau)
        - SPSS
        - JASP
    - Special formats for web data

        - Python
        - SQL
        - C / C++ / Java
        - BASH
        - Regex
3. Math - math behind DS methods
    - The foundation of data science
        - Need to know which procedures to use & why
        - Know what to do when things don't work right
        - Some math is easier/quicker to do by hand
    - What kinds of math
        - Elementary algebra
        - Linear (matrix) algebra
        - Linear equations
        - Calculus
        - Big O
        - Probability
        - Bayes' theorem
4. Stats
    - Find order in chaos
    - Explore data
        - Exploratory graphics
        - Exploratory statistics
        - Descriptive statistics
    - Inference
        - Take info about a smaple and infer something about population
        - Hypothesis testing
        - Estimation
    - Concerned with details
        - Feature selection (picking variables)
        - Problems
        - Validation
        - Estimators
5. Machine Learning
    - Categorize & predict
    - Many choices available
    - Insight is the goal (like statistics)

## Goals

Analysis is goal-driven
Story should match goals
Answer clearly

- State the question
- Give your answer
- Qualify as needed
- Go in order
- Discuss process sparingly
- More charts, less text
- Simplify charts
- Avoid tables
- Stories give value to data analysis
- Be minimally sufficient
- Give next steps
- Justify data
- Be specific
- Steps should be doable by the client
- Build on each step
- Data gives correlation, client wants causation
- Presentation graphics need clarity and narrative flow
  - Distractions include:
    - Colors
    - 3D
    - Interaction
    - Animation
- Reproduceable research
  - Archive data sets, both raw and processed
  - Archive all code to process / analyze data
  - Comment liberally
  - Explain why you did it the way you did

### Data

- Store in non-proprietary formats (like CSV)
- Place files in secure, accessible location (Github)
- Use dependency management package 
  - Packrat (R)
  - virtualenv (Python)
- Put narrative in notebook, or digital notebook (Jupyter)
